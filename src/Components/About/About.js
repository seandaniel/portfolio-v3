        <p>A web developer who has a passion for progressive technology, and well-designed products that provide meaningful solutions. My creativity stems from my passion for snowboarding, while my methodical way of thinking relates to following the Toronto Blue Jays. I am a Juno College graduate who takes pride in writing semantic, reusable code that produces web applications that engage with people, providing the best user experience. </p>
        <p>My experience consists of building web applications using HTML, CSS compiled with Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery with a strong focus in React. I am confident in using Git to collaborate, working with API integrations, and manipulating information in a database. Meeting web accessibility standards, responsive design, establishing SEO, and being able to manage a projectâ€™s scope are skills I possess. Clean interfaces with smooth transitions are adamant in my projects, all through maintainable stylesheets.</p>
